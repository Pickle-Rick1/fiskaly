# All that needs to be said.

There is nothing simpler than a circle, except perhaps a straight line,
but the circle contains a universe of meaning. As being a part of the brand’s name,
the filled circle works as ”The period“, which is perhaps the easiest punctuation mark
to master. It ends a sentence.

## Base Logo

<LogoBlock />

## Logo on any background.

Avoid the Period in brand primary color on colorful backgrounds.
Use white color for the Period and black for the brand name.
