# Keep it simple.

Systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated.
Therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity
should be avoided.

## Voice guidelines

As Fiskalyâ€™s voice, we should always:

- Be straightforward and easy to understand
- Be real, but not too pushy or overly familiar
- Be formal, but not to sassy or insensitive
- Be confident, but not needy

## Actionable language
Developers use Fiskaly to get things done.
Content should be written and structured to help them understand and
take the most important actions.
