# Encourage calmness, serenity, and strength

The color palette reinforces a dynamic, trusted, and engaging appeal for our communications.

## Brand Primary

The color **“Teal”** encourages objective, analytical and
deep thinking. It is unconventional, modern, and yet unique in its own
way. It also represents cleanliness as well as elegance. The calm shade
has a natural dignity that is not contrived. Thanks to the combination of
blue and green, teal provides a tranquil effect. Brighter teal tones are
unique and smart.
