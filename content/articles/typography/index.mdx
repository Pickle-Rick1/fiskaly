# Talk and type strong yet easy and clear

Fiskaly provides a constrained, purposeful set of typographic styles.

## Brand Font

**DM Sans** is our primary headline typeface. It has been selected for its approachability, geometry, and its clean modern look.
Itâ€™s used for titles, headlines, subheads, and short introductions. DM Sans is a geometric font.
It has quirks that give it a lot of warmth and friendly feel. Geometric fonts present a clean, simple design,
representing purity and balance. Consumers look for these qualities in brands they trust.

Pairing the geometric font with the monospace **DM Mono** gives Fiskaly the necessary appeal of developer domain.

## Body Copy

We use a font stack that adapts to the operating system it runs on, like macOS, iOS, Windows, Android or Linux distributions,
to make sure all browsers can load platform-specific fonts.
