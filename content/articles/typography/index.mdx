# Talk and type strong yet easy and clear

Fiskaly provides a constrained, purposeful set of typographic styles.

## Brand Font

**DM Sans** is our primary headline typeface. It has been selected for its approachability, geometry, and its clean modern look.
It’s used for titles, headlines, subheads, and short introductions. The typeface “DM Sans” is a geometric font.
It has quirks that give it a lot of warmth and friendly feel. Geometric fonts present a clean, simple design,
representing purity and balance. Consumers look for these qualities in brands they trust.

## Body Copy

We use a font stack that adapts to the operating system it runs on, like macOS, iOS, Windows, Android or Linux distributions,
to make sure all browsers can load platform-specific fonts.

- Devices running Windows will display [Segoe UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe#Segoe_UI)
- Machines running Linux will display the default sans-serif font for any running distribution
